# Perseus
A Discord report/feedback bot that can send messages from 1 server to another server where the bot joined as a feedback/report/anything else you can think about! Made with love using JavaScript and discord.js off course!

# Setup
### Step 1: Get the bot token [here](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
### Step 2: Put the token in the environment variables/lock button using **TOKEN** as the key, and your bot token as the value to log your bot in.
### Step 3: Change the bot prefix on index.js row number 15.
### Step 4: Change the channel ID's for the feedback/report message destination. How to do it? Choose 1 **text** channel on **YOUR** server. Make sure the Discord Developer Mode is turned on, right click the channel, click on "Copy ID". Paste the code on index.js row number 28.
### Step 5: You can change some inputs to your bot on other rows.
### Step 6: Now, simply hit the RUN button!
